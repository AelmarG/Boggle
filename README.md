# Boggle

This is all the code for my Boggle assignments in my Comparative Programming Languages class. 

In these assignments I had to create a program that could calculate the highest possible Boggle score based off of a board provided to it.

To create these programs I had to use important tools that were exclusive and useful for each of the languages I programmed in (Smalltalk, Elixir and Rust).
